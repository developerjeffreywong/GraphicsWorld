# GraphicsWorld
Graphics World is a computer science assignment that introduces students to the Python library pygame through the creation of a simple 2D game.

The game requires the player to collect an item 5 times while avoiding a monster.

In the source files included gives students a basic framework to build up the game. Initially, the student can see the player, the map (a grid) and move the player to the right. By looking at the given code, students should be able to create the rest of the game.
